Concepts of Programming Languages
Lab 3
Emmanuel Armstrong & Matthew Rohrlach



Question 1: 
	Got the output (3 8 9 2 4 10)

Question 2: 
	The function adds 1 to every number in the list, recursively.

Question 3:
	The line below (a) checks if the list is null before continuing with the program.  If the list is null there is nothing to be done.

Question 4:
	The line below (b) creates an empty list to be returned as output. This list is added at the end of cons recursion to ensure that at least an empty list is returned.

Question 5:
	f constructs a list, pulls off the first item of the argument list (CAR), adds 1 to that element, and calls the function recursively; building the list until the last element of the orignal list is processed. The newly constructed list is returned as output.

Question 6:
	Got the output #f

Question 7:
	Got the output #t
	
Question 8:
	Got the output #f

Question 9:
	Got the output #f

Question 10:
	Got the output (blue eggs cheese ham and sandwich)
	
Question 11:
	Got the output (blue cheese and)
	
Question 12:
	Once you figure out the basics it is fairly simple to figure out how to code
	
Question 13:
	Took quite a while just to figure out how to get started with it.  Plus the amount of parentheses can get confusing
	
Question 14:
	We probably spent 5 or 6 hours of actual work while doing this lab
	
Question 15:
	If I am ever in a situation where it would be useful then yes
